<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an extremely determined and self driven individual with an insatiable desire for learning.  I enjoy the creative process as well as solving problems.  My background includes sales management along with individual and team development. I transitioned from an HVAC engineer to software development with the same desire and satisfaction that I found in solving problems and ensuring systems work properly and efficiently. </p>
